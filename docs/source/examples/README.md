## Working with Flamingo

Submitting a Flamingo job includes two parts: a YAML file that specifies configuration for your finetuning or evaluation job, and a driver script that either invokes the Flamingo CLI directly or submits a job to Ray that invokes Flamingo as its entrypoint.

## Examples

For a full end-to-end interactive workflow running from within Flamingo, see the sample notebooks under `notebooks`.
